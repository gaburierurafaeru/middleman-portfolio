      <p>Hi everyone!</p>
      <p>With a background in Teaching and Digital Marketing and a rich international experience, I was keen to develop my skills further. I chose <strong>Le Wagon</strong>’s bootcamp in Tokyo to do so and graduated in September 2023. I had the opportunity to learn and build a strong foundation in full stack programming and worked in a team on multiple web projects. </p>
      <p>Transitioning into web development allowed me to blend my creativity with technical skills, which sparked my interest in front-end development. I have a keen eye for design, a love for challenges, and a knack for adapting – qualities that make me a dynamic front-end developer. Driven by my passion for travel, languages, and culture, I thrive in diverse environments and embrace the opportunity to create meaningful digital experiences.</p>
      <p>Passionate about creating engaging user experiences, I am actively seeking a front-end developer position in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts and potential employers in Tokyo!</p>
